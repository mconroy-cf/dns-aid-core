"""
DNS-AID Validator: Verify agent DNS records and security.

Handles DNSSEC validation, DANE/TLSA verification, and endpoint health checks.

DNSSEC requirement posture (draft-mozleywilliams-dnsop-dnsaid-02 §6.2):

The draft uses the **SHOULD** posture, not MAY/MUST. Verbatim:

    "Consumers SHOULD authenticate the TLS endpoint of a DNS-AID agent
    using DANE TLSA records (RFC 6698) wherever both DNSSEC and TLSA
    are available."

DNS-AID records served without DNSSEC continue to verify under this
module — DNSSEC absence is not in itself a failure. When TLSA records
ARE present, DNSSEC absence makes the TLSA records untrustworthy
(RFC 6698 §10.1 — TLSA without DNSSEC offers no integrity guarantee).

When TLSA records are present without a validated DNSSEC chain the
validator treats DANE as untrustworthy: ``dane_valid`` is demoted to
``None`` and the +15 ``security_score`` credit is gated on
``dnssec_valid``, so an unsigned TLSA record cannot inflate the trust
score.

    Check DANE/TLSA record for the endpoint.

    When ``verify_cert`` is False (default), this only checks whether a TLSA
    record exists in DNS.  When True, it additionally connects to the endpoint
    via TLS, retrieves the certificate, and compares its digest against the
    TLSA association data.

    Every association in the RRset is tried: the certificate is valid if it
    matches ANY of them (RFC 6698; RFC 7671 Section 5.1). This is what allows a
    certificate rollover to publish the outgoing and incoming pins side by side
    (RFC 7671 Section 8.1) without verification depending on RRset ordering.

    Args:
        target: Hostname of the endpoint.
        port: Port number.
        verify_cert: If True, perform full certificate matching against TLSA.

    Returns:
        True if TLSA record exists (and, with ``verify_cert``, some association
        matched the presented certificate)
        False if TLSA records exist and EVERY association was compared and
