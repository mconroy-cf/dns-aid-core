JWS Signature Support for DNS-AID.

Provides an application-layer verification alternative when DNSSEC is not available.
Publishers sign SVCB record content with their private key and include the signature
in a `sig` parameter. Verifiers fetch the public key from `.well-known/dns-aid-jwks.json`.

Key format: ECDSA P-256 (ES256) for compact signatures suitable for DNS records.

Usage:
    # Publisher: Generate keypair
    private_key, public_key = generate_keypair()
    jwks = export_jwks(public_key, kid="dns-aid-2024")

    # Publisher: Sign record
    signature = sign_record(payload, private_key)

    # Verifier: Verify signature
    is_valid = await verify_record_signature(domain, payload, signature)

# The JWKS is served from a dedicated host derived from the publishing zone,
# not from the zone apex.
#
# Deriving the location rather than accepting a pointer is deliberate. This
# path runs precisely when the DNS answer is NOT authenticated, so a pointer
# carried in the record could not be trusted to name the key: an attacker able
# to forge the record could forge the pointer, serve their own JWKS, and sign
# with their own key -- and signing the pointer would not help, because the
# attacker controls both halves. A derived name cannot be steered at all, and
# it is inside the publisher's registrable domain by construction, so no
# public-suffix check is needed.
#
# A dedicated host (rather than the apex) is what keeps this deployable: it is
# a fresh name that may CNAME to a gateway, CDN, or bucket, whereas a zone apex
# may not. Zones that exist only to carry agent records need no web presence.
# Same reasoning and shape as MTA-STS (RFC 8461 Section 3.1), which requires
# mta-sts.<domain> rather than the apex.
#
# An underscore label is not an option here: CA/Browser Forum baseline
# requirements bar underscores from certificate dNSName SANs, and this host is
# fetched over HTTPS. (`_agents` is DNS-only, so it correctly keeps its
# underscore; this host cannot.)
# TRUST LIMIT of the JWS fallback, stated where the location is defined.
#
# The document is fetched over HTTPS from a name INSIDE the zone the fallback
# exists to protect, so its authenticity rests on WebPKI for that name. An
# attacker with zone-level DNS control -- the adversary this fallback is meant to
# stop -- can satisfy an ACME DNS-01 or HTTP-01 challenge for dns-aid.<zone>,
# obtain a DV certificate, and serve their own JWKS. Against that adversary JWS
# reduces to WebPKI rather than being an independent anchor.
#
# It remains worthwhile against a weaker attacker (off-path spoofing, a poisoned
# cache, a compromised resolver) who cannot also obtain a certificate. Closing
# the gap needs an out-of-band pin -- a TLSA record for the JWKS host, a key
# fingerprint carried in the SVCB record, or trust-on-first-use with change
# alerting -- and that is a protocol decision, not a local change.

# You cannot bootstrap trust from inside a zone an attacker controls. Any pin
# carried in the record is forged alongside the record, and the JWKS is fetched
# over WebPKI for a name in that same zone, so an adversary with zone-level DNS
# control can obtain a DV certificate and serve their own document. That is a
# property of the layer, not a bug to patch.
#
# What IS achievable is detectability. An attacker who swaps the key set must
# swap the key, and a key change is observable. Trust-on-first-use with change
# alerting turns a silent substitution into a loud one, needs no protocol change,
# and costs one hash per zone.
#
# Deliberately advisory: this NEVER refuses a signature. A publisher rotating
# keys legitimately must not have discovery break, and treating a rotation as an
# attack would be the unverifiable-reads-as-forgery inversion this module exists
# to avoid. It reports; the operator decides.
