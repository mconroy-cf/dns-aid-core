"""JWKS document location is derived, not declared.

Two properties are under test:

1. The location comes from a dedicated ``dns-aid.<zone>`` host rather than the
   zone apex. A zone that exists only to carry agent records has no web
   presence at its apex, so requiring HTTPS there made the JWS path
   undeployable for exactly the delegated-namespace shape it was meant to
   serve. The derived host is a fresh name and may CNAME anywhere.

2. The zone is taken from the record, not from the caller's ``discover()``
   argument. Otherwise the same record verifies against a different JWKS
   depending on how discovery was entered, and a publisher would have to serve
   the document at every name a consumer might use.

No pointer is involved by design: this path runs when the DNS answer is
unauthenticated, so a pointer in the record could be forged alongside it.
