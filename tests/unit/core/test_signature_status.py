"""Signature verification reports *why*, and key rollovers can overlap.

Two related properties.

Tri-state: an unreachable JWKS is unknown, not forged. Reporting a network
fault as a failed signature both misdirects the operator and, worse, trains
them to ignore the signal that a real forgery would raise. ``require_signed``
stays fail-closed throughout -- it demands ``is True``, so ``None`` is still
rejected; the change is in what the record *reports*, not in what passes.

Rollover: a signature names the key that produced it (``kid``), so the outgoing
and incoming keys can sit in one JWKS while records are re-signed. Without it
every signature is tried against every key, nothing is attributable to a
signer, and a newly published key is invisible until the cache expires.
