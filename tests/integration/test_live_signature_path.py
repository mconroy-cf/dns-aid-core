"""Live verification of the record-signature path against published zones.

Gated behind DNS_AID_LIVE_TESTS=1 so CI stays hermetic:

    DNS_AID_LIVE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/integration/test_live_signature_path.py -x -q

Why this file exists: the ``sig`` SvcParam was published correctly and dropped
during parsing for several releases, and no unit test caught it because the
suite constructed AgentRecord objects directly with ``sig=`` pre-set -- mocking
the exact seam where the defect lived. These tests drive real DNS answers
through the real parser.

Resolver pinning is deliberate. ``dnssec_validated`` follows the AD flag, which
only a validating resolver sets, so a non-validating resolver reports False for
the same signed zone that 8.8.8.8 reports True for. Whether the host running
these tests validates is not knowable in advance and changes with the network,
so an unpinned live test is not reproducible. Pin, and assert the difference
rather than leaving it to be rediscovered.
